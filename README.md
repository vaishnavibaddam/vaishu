AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis and Medicine Recommendation System
This project utilizes Machine Learning (ML) to predict diseases based on user-inputted symptoms and provides medicine recommendations, dietary advice, precautions, and detailed descriptions for improved healthcare guidance. It features an interactive Streamlit-based interface that simplifies access to AI-powered medical insights.
Features
- Disease Prediction: AI analyzes symptoms to provide possible medical conditions.
- Medicine Recommendations: Suggests suitable medicines based on predicted disease.
- Dietary Guidance: Provides diet recommendations for better health management.
- Precautionary Measures: Offers safety tips and preventive actions for diseases.
- Detailed Descriptions: Displays information on medical conditions for awareness.
- Streamlit UI: A user-friendly navigation menu with sections for prediction, medicines, diets, precautions, and descriptions.

Technologies Used
- Machine Learning (ML) – Trains AI models for disease prediction.
- Streamlit – Used for interactive web-based navigation and visualization.
- Python – Core programming language for backend and AI model development.
